
"""By default, Django signals do not automatically run in the same database transaction as the caller. The behavior of signals with respect to database transactions depends on how they are used, especially if the signal is connected to a particular event in the request lifecycle.

However, Django provides transaction.on_commit() for cases where you want to ensure that signals or their side effects occur only after a database transaction has been successfully committed.

To conclusively prove this, we can use a Django signal and show that without explicit use of transaction.on_commit(), a signal's actions can occur before the transaction commits, leading to potentially incorrect behavior if the transaction later fails"""
